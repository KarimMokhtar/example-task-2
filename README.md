# Overview

# Getting started
Before you start you should have a recent version of `npm` and `node`
installed.
To start the server go into the `server` directory and run
```
  npm install
  node index.js
```
To see whether the server works check <http://localhost:3000> and see if you get a JSON object with a hello world json object.

To build the client go into the directory `client` and run
```
npm install
npm run start
```
Then open the file `client/dist/index.hmtl` in the browser. Make sure that the
server is still running!
